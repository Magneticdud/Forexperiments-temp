# Forexperiments-temp
It's a temporary repo for my hugo website that's using the bilberry theme

english version: www.forexperiments.com

italian version: www.forexperimenti.it

generated via "hugo --destination /mysites" then uploaded the generated files to those domains

the bilberry theme is cloned into themes/bilberry as a git submodule

git submodule update --recursive --remote
